Dealing with bugs in CVS or this manual
***************************************

   Neither CVS nor this manual is perfect, and they probably never will
be.  If you are having trouble using CVS, or think you have found a
bug, there are a number of things you can do about it.  Note that if
the manual is unclear, that can be considered a bug in the manual, so
these problems are often worth doing something about as well as
problems with CVS itself.

   * If you want someone to help you and fix bugs that you report,
     there are companies which will do that for a fee.  One such
     company is:

          Ximbiot
          319 S. River St.
          Harrisburg, PA  17104-1657
          USA
          Email: info@ximbiot.com
          Phone: (717) 579-6168
          Fax:   (717) 234-3125
          <http://ximbiot.com/>

   * If you got CVS through a distributor, such as an operating system
     vendor or a vendor of freeware CD-ROMs, you may wish to see
     whether the distributor provides support.  Often, they will provide
     no support or minimal support, but this may vary from distributor
     to distributor.

   * If you have the skills and time to do so, you may wish to fix the
     bug yourself.  If you wish to submit your fix for inclusion in
     future releases of CVS, see the file HACKING in the CVS source
     distribution.  It contains much more information on the process of
     submitting fixes.

   * There may be resources on the net which can help.  Two good places
     to start are:

          <http://www.cvshome.org>
          <http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html>

     If you are so inspired, increasing the information available on
     the net is likely to be appreciated.  For example, before the
     standard CVS distribution worked on Windows 95, there was a web
     page with some explanation and patches for running CVS on Windows
     95, and various people helped out by mentioning this page on
     mailing lists or newsgroups when the subject came up.

   * It is also possible to report bugs to <bug-cvs@gnu.org>.  Note
     that someone may or may not want to do anything with your bug
     report--if you need a solution consider one of the options
     mentioned above.  People probably do want to hear about bugs which
     are particularly severe in consequences and/or easy to fix,
     however.  You can also increase your odds by being as clear as
     possible about the exact nature of the bug and any other relevant
     information.  The way to report bugs is to send email to
     <bug-cvs@gnu.org>.  Note that submissions to <bug-cvs@gnu.org> may
     be distributed under the terms of the GNU Public License, so if
     you don't like this, don't submit them.  There is usually no
     justification for sending mail directly to one of the CVS
     maintainers rather than to <bug-cvs@gnu.org>; those maintainers
     who want to hear about such bug reports read <bug-cvs@gnu.org>.
     Also note that sending a bug report to other mailing lists or
     newsgroups is _not_ a substitute for sending it to
     <bug-cvs@gnu.org>.  It is fine to discuss CVS bugs on whatever
     forum you prefer, but there are not necessarily any maintainers
     reading bug reports sent anywhere except <bug-cvs@gnu.org>.

   People often ask if there is a list of known bugs or whether a
particular bug is a known one.  The file BUGS in the CVS source
distribution is one list of known bugs, but it doesn't necessarily try
to be comprehensive.  Perhaps there will never be a comprehensive,
detailed list of known bugs.
